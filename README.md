The website provides carefully picked yoga asanas and pranayamas for health problems which can be practiced by all age group to get relief from pain and maintain a healthy life. There is a section of QnA also that is actually a BOT

For making this website, I have used the following Azure services:
1) Visual Studio Code:- I used this editor to make the HTML and CSS file.
2) Azure Storage Account:- I used this service to store HTML file, CSS file and all the asset(images) and to host my website online.
3) QnA Maker:- I used this service to make knowledge base for my BOT.
4) Azure Bot Service:- I used this service to make a friendly bot that will use my knowledge base to provide best possible answer for every question asked.
