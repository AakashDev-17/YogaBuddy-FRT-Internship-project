# YogaBuddy-FRT-Internship-project

**Problem Statement:**

In today's scenario, most of us are doing our work from home, which agerlly affects our health, and causes many problem and makes us unfit. So to help us in this situation there should be a website that should contain solution to all the health related problem using YOGA and PRANAYAMAS.
So, in this project I have designed a website named "YogaBuddy" that provide solution to day to day health related issues using Yoga asanas and Pranayamas.

**Project Description:**

The website provides carefully picked yoga asanas and pranayamas for health problems which can be practiced by all age group to get relief from pain and maintain a healthy life. There is a section of QnA also that is actually a BOT, which will help to communicate more easily.

For making this website, I have used the following Azure services:
1) Visual Studio Code:- I used this editor to make the HTML and CSS file.
2) Azure Storage Account:- I used this service to store HTML file, CSS file and all the asset(images) and to host my website online.
3) QnA Maker:- I used this service to make knowledge base for my BOT.
4) Azure Bot Service:- I used this service to make a friendly bot that will use my knowledge base to provide best possible answer for every question asked.
